## Why This Exists

  

Instagram, like many social platforms, has undergone significant enshittification - a term coined to describe how platforms evolve:

  

1. First, they attract users with a quality experience

2. Then, they leverage their position to extract data and attention

3. Finally, they degrade the user experience to maximize profit

  

Also, the output that Instagram gives you when you request an export contains a lot of data but it feels like it's intentionally hard to access.
