## How to Use

Memento Mori is designed to be super user-friendly:

1. Request and download your Instagram data archive
2. Extract the archive to a folder
3. Place the index.html file in the same folder as your extracted archive
4. Open index.html in your browser to view your reconstituted Instagram account

## Why This Exists

Instagram, like many social platforms, has undergone significant "enshittification" - a term coined to describe how platforms evolve:

1. First, they attract users with a quality experience
2. Then, they leverage their position to extract data and attention
3. Finally, they degrade the user experience to maximize profit

When requesting your data from Instagram, the export you receive contains all your content but in a format that's intentionally difficult to navigate and enjoy. Memento Mori solves this problem by transforming your archive into an intuitive, familiar interface that brings your memories back to life.
